I'm Iroh Cao. I work as a machine learning engineer in the US during the day. At night, I am a senior research scientist at Shenzhen Children’s Hospital AI Lab. My goal is to apply newest self-supervised learning, computer vision algorithm in Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and self-driving preception. Life goes on, work goes on.       


### 📫 Research Update    

I am happy to share our collaborative research paper "ViTASD: Robust Vision Transformer Baselines for Autism Spectrum Disorder Facial Diagnosis" accepted by ICASSP 2023 this year. Wenqian Ye and I will go to ICASSP 2023 to present our work. [ViTASD: Robust Vision Transformer Baselines for Autism Spectrum Disorder Facial Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16943).     

My commentary paper: "Commentary: machine learning for autism spectrum disorder diagnosis: challenges and opportunities" is accepted by [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14697610), one of the top journal for Autism. The full manuscript will release soon.     

I am happy to share our collaborative research paper "THMA: Tencent HD Map AI System for Creating HD Map Annotations" accepted by IAAI 2023 this year. I will go to AAAI 2023 to present our work. Welcome to participate AAAI 2023 in Washington, D.C and chat with me. Cheer! [THMA: Tencent HD Map AI System for Creating HD Map Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11123).     


### ⚡️ A quick introduction

- 🔭 I'm currently working at a famous Stealth Startup in the bay areas. And serve as senior research scientist at Shenzhen Children’s Hospital AI Lab.    
- 🌱 I’m currently researching Self-supervised learning with diffusion model, BEV Perception in LiDAR, self-driving systems, AI for Pediatrics, AI for Social Good.    
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building the general AI for Pediatrics around the world. If you also interested in this topic, I can provide financial support with my lab in Shenzhen Children's Hopsital and we are supporting summer / winter remote research internship.
