I'm Iroh Cao. I am a machine learning engineer in the US. I am also the co-founder and senior research scientist at PediaMed.AI Lab at Shenzhen Children’s Hospital. My goal is to apply newest self-supervised learning, computer vision algorithm in Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and self-driving preception. Life goes on, work goes on. I am busy with several research project and will stop reply any message via email.

### 👯 Hiring!    
My team in Shenzhen are hiring 1-2 summer research interns at Shenzhen Children's Hospital AI Lab. The summer research intern will have a chance to use all of our private clinical dataset and  collaborate on 1-2 Pediatrics AI papers / Pediatrics AI Challenges that will be submitted to NeurIPS/CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/IJCAI/AAAI. The position is paid with a monthly subsidy ￥4000. If you are interested in this position, please email irohcao@gmail.com.


### 📫 Research Update    

The 1st WACV Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD) will be hold in Waikoloa, Hawaii. I am the main workshop and challenge organizer. Join us in Jan 4, 2024 to explore how large language models contribute to self-driving.
