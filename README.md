I'm Iroh Cao. I work as a machine learning engineer in the US during the day. At night, I am a senior research scientist at Shenzhen Children’s Hospital AI Lab. My goal is to apply newest self-supervised learning, computer vision algorithm in Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and self-driving preception. Life goes on, work goes on.   

### 👯 Hiring!    
We are hiring 1-2 summer research interns at Shenzhen Children's Hospital AI Lab. The summer research intern will have a chance to use all of our private clinical dataset and  collaborate on 1-2 Pediatrics AI papers / Pediatrics AI Challenges that will be submitted to NeurIPS/CVPR/ICCV/ECCV/IJCAI/AAAI. The position is paid with a monthly subsidy. If you are interested in this position, please email irohcao@gmail.com.


### 📫 Research Update    

I am happy to share our collaborative research paper "[ViTASD: Robust Vision Transformer Baselines for Autism Spectrum Disorder Facial Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16943)" accepted by ICASSP 2023 this year. Wenqian Ye and I will go to ICASSP 2023 to present our work.     

My commentary paper: "[Commentary: machine learning for autism spectrum disorder diagnosis: challenges and opportunities](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcpp.13764)" is accepted by [Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry](https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14697610), one of the top journal for Autism.     

Our collaborative research paper [THMA: Tencent HD Map AI System for Creating HD Map Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11123) won IAAI 'Innovative Application' Award at AAAI 2023.    


### ⚡️ A quick introduction

- 🔭 I'm currently working at a famous Stealth Startup in the bay areas. And serve as a research fellow at Shenzhen Children’s Hospital AI Lab. I am the PI of the laboratory with $30,000 start up funding. We are hiring undergraduate and master students as summer internship.     
- 🌱 I’m currently researching diffusion model, Self-supervised learning, BEV Perception in LiDAR, AI for Pediatrics, AI for Social Good.    
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on building the general AI for Pediatrics around the world. If you also interested in this topic, I can provide financial support with my lab in Shenzhen Children's Hopsital and we are supporting summer / winter remote research internship.
