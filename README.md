### 📫 Research Update    

Our paper [What is the Visual Cognition Gap between Humans and Multimodal LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10424) has been accepted to COLM 2025.

Our paper [SocialGesture: Delving into Multi-person Gesture Understanding](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Cao_SocialGesture_Delving_into_Multi-person_Gesture_Understanding_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf) has been accepted to CVPR 2025.

I am leading the organization of the [ICLR 2025 Workshop on AI for Children](https://pediamedai.com/ai4chl/). As a former patient with a rare pediatric disease, I am deeply committed to leveraging AI to improve healthcare outcomes for children facing medical challenges. Through my workshop, I hope to found a team to foster interdisciplinary discussions and drive impactful research in AI-driven pediatric care.
