### 📫 Research Update    

Our SocialGesture paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025.

I am leading the organization of the [ICLR 2025 Workshop on AI for Children](https://pediamedai.com/ai4chl/). As a former patient with a rare pediatric disease, I am deeply committed to leveraging AI to improve healthcare outcomes for children facing medical challenges. Through my workshop, I hope to found a team to foster interdisciplinary discussions and drive impactful research in AI-driven pediatric care.

I am serving as the Research roundtable subchair of Machine Learning for Health Symposium (ML4H 2024). Our research roundtable summary is aviliable [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06693).
